## Project Overview

This is a continuation of project CS370 which was a reinforcement learning agent which demonstrated the algorithms commonly used in the machine learning. The goal was to train an intelligent agent capable of navigating a maze-like environment to locate a treasure. The agent learns optimal actions through iterative feedback, using Q-learning to maximize its cumulative reward.

This project will be substantially revised to incorporate best practices into the code a full refactoring to object-oriented design by dividing the structure into classes and scripts. The algorithms will be expanded to improve training and provide an optional selection of algorithms. The development of a SQLite database to save configurations, training results, and parameters for closer inspection. Provide generous documentation and testing, and a pleasing dashboard for the user.
